        Snakes as you can probably guess are best known for slithering around as they do not have legs. Snakes are also well known for being evil in most forms of media because they are represented as untrustworthy and deceiving. Snakes are also well known for eating small vermin like mice, rats, and other rodents. Snakes are also cold blooding so they don’t produce their own body heat and they rely on the suns heat to stay warm. Snakes smell with their tounge as they don’t have noses. Snakes don't chew their food and swallow their food whole. Once a month they shed their skin. Most snakes lay eggs and only very few give birth.
